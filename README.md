## How to Run the Test Cases

The **interpreter.py** file requires the user to add the ‘txt’ file’s name to be read from the **test_case** folder as an additional [command line parameter](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_command_line_arguments.htm) and executes that test case by reading that file. 

Example prompt:
```
python3 interpreter.py standard_output.txt
```

Example output in cmd:
```
STANDARD OUTPUT
5.4 TRUE 2
```
